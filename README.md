## 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

### [CustomDistillation](https://github.com/Harshvardhan-To1/CustomDistillation)
- **Objective**: Developed a two-step method for LLM (Large Language Model) distillation optimized for low VRAM environments.
- **Highlights**:
  - **Stage 1**: Saved logits generated by the teacher model to reduce runtime memory usage.
  - **Stage 2**: Performed distillation using KL-divergence between the student model and pre-saved logits.
  - Enabled efficient model training for users with limited hardware resources without sacrificing performance.
  - Built using PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and Accelerate.
